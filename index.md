# About
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia. My research interests include international finance and the economics of sovereign debt issuance in emerging market economies. My current projects focus on the relationship between global fluctuations in risk aversion and the currency composition of sovereign debt.

I am on the 2025–2026 job market. I’m happy to discuss my work, graduate school applications, or collaboration opportunities. Feel free to get in touch by email at jw5gc@virginia.edu.
